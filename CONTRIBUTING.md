# Contributing

* Be focused on actual facts, not planned features, or discussed probabilities.
* Provide references to source – source code, github issue, forum post etc. – whenever possible.
* It's better to **cite**, than rephrase or write content by yourself, unless it's required for clarity of text.
* It's best to traverse forum topics from the oldest to the newest, to collect most up-to-date info.
